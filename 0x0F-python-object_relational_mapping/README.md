# ``list T from DB ``

Let's break down the code line by line:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- This is called a shebang line and specifies the path to the Python interpreter that should be used to execute the script. In this case, it points to the Python 3 interpreter.

```python
# Lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa.
# Usage: ./0-select_states.py <mysql username> \
#                             <mysql password> \
#                             <database name>
```
- These are comments that provide a description of the script's purpose and usage. They explain that the script lists all states from a database called `hbtn_0e_0_usa` and how to use it with command-line arguments.

```python
import sys
```
- This line imports the `sys` module, which provides access to command-line arguments and other system-related functions.

```python
import MySQLdb
```
- This line imports the `MySQLdb` module, which is a Python interface for interacting with MySQL databases.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
```
- This line checks whether the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported as a module into another script). Code within this block will only execute if the script is the main entry point.

```python
    db = MySQLdb.connect(user=sys.argv[1], passwd=sys.argv[2], db=sys.argv[3])
```
- This line establishes a connection to a MySQL database using the `MySQLdb.connect()` method. It uses the command-line arguments provided when running the script:
   - `sys.argv[1]`: The first argument is the MySQL username.
   - `sys.argv[2]`: The second argument is the MySQL password.
   - `sys.argv[3]`: The third argument is the name of the database.

```python
    c = db.cursor()
```
- This line creates a cursor object named `c`. A cursor is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.

```python
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM `states`")
```
- This line executes an SQL query using the cursor. The query selects all columns (`*`) from the `states` table in the connected database.

```python
    [print(state) for state in c.fetchall()]
```
- This line uses a list comprehension to iterate through the result set obtained from executing the query. It fetches all rows using `c.fetchall()` and iterates through them, printing each row to the console using the `print()` function.

In summary, this script connects to a MySQL database, executes a query to select all states from a table called `states`, and then prints the results to the console. It takes three command-line arguments: the MySQL username, password, and database name, which are used to establish the database connection.
