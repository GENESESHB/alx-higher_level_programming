# tasks ðŸš€

#return string 

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/node
```

This line is called a shebang, which is used to specify the interpreter for the script. It's correctly set to `/usr/bin/node` for Node.js.

```javascript
if (process.argv.length < 3) {
```

This line starts an `if` statement. It checks the length of the `process.argv` array, which contains command-line arguments. In the context of this script, it's checking if there are fewer than 3 arguments.

```javascript
console.log('No argument');
```

If there are fewer than 3 arguments, this line prints "No argument" to the console.

```javascript
} else if (process.argv.length === 3) {
```

This line starts an `else if` statement. It checks if there are exactly 3 arguments.

```javascript
console.log('Argument found');
```

If there are exactly 3 arguments, this line prints "Argument found" to the console.

```javascript
} else {
```

This line starts an `else` block, which executes if there are more than 3 arguments.

```javascript
console.log('Arguments found');
```

If there are more than 3 arguments, this line prints "Arguments found" to the console.

Your original code is correct and accomplishes the task as described in your initial request. It checks the number of command-line arguments and provides different output messages accordingly:

- If there are fewer than 3 arguments, it prints "No argument."
- If there are exactly 3 arguments, it prints "Argument found."
- If there are more than 3 arguments, it prints "Arguments found."
